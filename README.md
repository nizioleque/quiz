# Quiz app

[**Live demo**](https://quiz.niziolek.dev/)

This is called a quiz app, but it's actually a questionnaire app.

## Running locally

1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
2. Run the dev server: `yarn dev`
3. Visit http://localhost:5173/

## Extra features

- Animation between questions
- Progress bar
- Conditional navigation
- Support for optional and single/multi-line input questions
- Responsive design
- Attention to accessibility

## Potential improvements

While I tried to achieve high code quality, it's not perfect because of the time limitations.

There are a couple of TODOs left in the code for edge case handling (errors, validation, etc.)
